# CTLs_on_chips

## Content

This is the readme document presenting the analysis codes and pipelines for the project [“A Multiscale Immuno-Oncology on-Chip System (MIOCS) establishes that collective T cell behaviors govern tumor regression”](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.435334v1).

The folder contains three Jupyter Notebooks:
 - `data_processing` handles the post-processing of the raw CSV files containing the CTL tracks
 - `hitting_times_simulation` presents the scripts used to estimate the accumulation rate parameters lambda
 - `simulation` presents the simulation taking into account the combined collective effects detected in the droplets

The raw data is available upon request to the authors.
